                The Journey Behind Klassroom
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Klassroom started as a passion project to bring modern,
                human-centered education to Bangladesh and beyond. After facing
                the challenges of conventional learning systems, our founder
                envisioned a platform where education meets innovation, empathy,
                and relevance. What began as a simple idea is now growing into a
                dynamic ecosystem of learners, mentors, and changemakers.
